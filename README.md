# Movie Gallery

## Description

This is a full-stack single page app that allows users to create and track movies. Users are able to add and delete movies. Using React, the app will dynamically update in response to any changes. They are also able to click on a movie in the gallery to navigate to a details view of the movie.

## Installation & Usage

Fork and clone this repository. This app requires Node.js. If already installed, run "npm install" to install any dependencies.

PostgreSQL and Postico are also needed for this app. Once installed, connect to localhost on port 5432, and import the database.sql file to get the database set up.

You will need two terminals to run this app. In one, run "npm run server" and in the other run "npm run client" to start the app, and navigate to https://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the app.

The app will send movies to and from the database. New movies can be added through a form by clicking on the add new movie button. Clicking on a movie in the gallery view will direct the client to a detail view of the movie. Movies can be deleted using the remove button in the detail view.
